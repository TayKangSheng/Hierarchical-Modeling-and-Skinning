1.
Did asked some questions when I’m stuck.  
eg. Asked nikhil whether am i supposed to compute all the values in Joint class myself.  
eg. Asked Jermaine whether he had the issue of the model suddenly scaling 4 times smaller when ever he slide the slider. He reminded me to clear the stack, which helped.  
Did not collaborate with anyone as i wrote all the code myself..  

2. 
Referenced Github.  
But i didn’t copy any code.. for parts that i don’t understand, referenced, understood and wrote every line of code myself. I swear.  

3. 
When you slide too much on the slider, the joints can go humanely impossible angles. and the mesh might go haywire. Maybe there should be a limit to how much each part can turn.  

4. 
No. I did not do any extra credits.

The description in the course website could have been a lot more helpful in explaining. Because the fact is that none of these are really taught in class? What ever that is taught in class is pretty abstract, and when you really have to code it out you have to do things in detail and you realise theres no where to find the answers to your questions. (not considering digging textbooks and websites as an option because if you really try and dig from these places, you would spent double the time going through all the materials and to find that 5% of what you found were actually relevant.) Therefore just a little more guidance would go a long way in helping us really learn and to achieve course deliverables at the end of the term.  

Honestly its still pretty fun doing graphics assignment if not for the immense amount of other things happening in school together with the assignment.  

Peace out.  

P.S. the artefact is supposed to be someone kicking a soccer ball, but it also looks like someone dancing or someone leaping :D
